For the first time:
	0. Build an ARM toolchain (see the toolchain folder); will take a while (but you don't have to repeat that step, unless the toolchain is updated)
Then:
	1. Compile OpeniBoot:
		A. To run openiboot from the recovery mode (a.K.a iboot), you'll need to create an img3 image.
			a. A system capable of running x86 Linux binaries is required.
			b. For iPod touch: PLATFORM=IPOD make openiboot.img3
			c. For iPhone 2G: PLATFORM=IPHONE make openiboot.img3
			d. For iPhone 3G: PLATFORM=3G make openiboot.img3
	2. Compile all in client/ : cd client && make all && cd .. (requires libusb, libreadline and pthread)
	3. sudo client/loadibec openiboot.img3
	4. Run the client: sudo client/oibc
To install openiboot in the NOR (optional): run	"install" in openiboot client (to uninstall, restore/update/run QuickPwn)

To update openiboot:
	0. Pull the new code from Git: ("git pull" if you downloaded the code using Git)
	1. Compile openiboot, but this time you don't have to make an img3 image.
		a. For iPod touch: PLATFORM=IPOD make
		b. For iPhone 2G: PLATFORM=IPHONE make
		c. For iPhone 3G: PLATFORM=3G make
	2. Compile all in client/: cd client && make all && cd .. (requires libusb, libreadline and pthread)
	3. Launch openiboot
	4. Run the client: sudo client/oibc
	5. Copy the openiboot binary in the device memory: !openiboot.bin
	6. Jump to it: go 0x09000000 
	7. Relaunch openiboot console
	8. Relaunch the client: sudo client/oibc
	9. Install the new version: install
